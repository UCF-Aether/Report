\section{Design}
In this section, we present our proposed design for the sensor node, remote server, and gateway. We present this design only after thoroughly performing background research related the Air Quality Index, researching various hardware and software engineering standards, and exploring various potential components. This design combines the information that was collected in previous sections along with our defined requirements and specifications. In order to fully detail our design, we will be both describing our and design as well as including relevant hardware schematics and software flowcharts and diagrams. These will assist in the clarification and understanding of our design.
