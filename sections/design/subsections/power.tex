\subsection{Power System}
This section will look at the overall design that will power the nodes in the Aether Sensing Network. The Aether nodes will consist of a solar panel capable of powering the system while also charging the Lithium-Ion battery that will be used if the load demand exceeds the capabilities of the solar panel. Additionally, the node will be equipped with a USB-mini-B port to charge the battery and power the system as a second option. This gives users of the design the flexibility to directly charge a depleted battery and maintain the system operational in situations where the solar panel cannot provide sufficient power. A battery charge management controller will be responsible for a voltage proportional charge control feature that will optimize the solar cell and will also allow the USB input to power the system. At the output end of the charge controller will be a linear dropout regulator (LDO) to drop down the voltage to a constant 3.3V which will be used as the main power line for the system.
\subsubsection{Overall Features}
A 3.7V/4.2V Lithium-Ion battery will be the main battery source in this design. The battery can be charged through one of 3 methods:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A 6V solar panel
    \item USB-mini-B input
    \item A 5V DC adapter in place of the solar panel
\end{itemize}

The design incorporates automatic charging current tracking through the battery charge management controller IC. This allows the system to operate at high efficiencies with solar panels of varying wattages. Three LED's will be used to indicate battery charge status to the user. The orange LED indicates the battery capacity is low and it’s charging; the green LED indicates the battery has been fully charged; the red LED indicates power is good and the system is on. A maximum charge rate of 500 mA is outputted by the charge controller and it is adjustable from 50 mA to up to a 1A charge rate. Our system is designed to draw the most amount of current possible, depending on the set maximum charge rate, from the solar panel to meet load requirements. If the load requires more current it will then turn to the battery. This smart load sharing automatically uses input power if available which prevents the battery from frequently charging and discharging and therefore extending the battery life. Since the Aether nodes are also intended for outdoor use, battery temperature was a factor that needed to be considered. If the Lithium-ion battery temperature exceeds a certain limit, charging it could potentially be dangerous. Therefore, the design will include a 10k NTC thermistor connected to the charge controller IC to monitor battery temperature and automatically stop charging the battery if temperature thresholds are met. 

\subsubsection{Solar Panel Charging}
The nodes in the Aether Sensing Network will use Voltaic Systems’ 5.5 W 6 V solar panel to charge and power the node. A DC jack input will be used to connect the solar panel to the system. Charging the system with a solar panel means a filtering capacitor will be needed to stabilize the solar panel. A relatively large 4700 microfarad capacitor will be used on the PCB for this design. The biggest question of this solar powered system was whether to incorporate Max Power Point Tracker (MPPT) into the design. MPPT works by monitoring the voltage and current output curves of the solar panel in order to maximize the total power output of the panel. Since the voltage and current outputs of a solar panel are dependent on the amount of light outside, solar panel reading need to be consistently monitored. Typically, MPPT is done through the use of DC/DC buck converters so when solar panel voltages vary the buck converter will maintain the current draw to maximize the power output of the solar panel. Although MPPT increase solar efficiency, there were some critical downsides if used in this power design. The first is that DC/DC converters would increase the cost of the design as well as the size and circuit complexity, while only providing a maximum of 30\% increase in efficiency to small voltage solar panels. Additionally, when compared to applications with small voltages and currents, MPPT is not much more efficient than a linear converter. A 6V panel responsible of charging a ~4V battery will have an MPPT around 5V, since the linear charger will have an input diode with a 0.5V dropout, the inefficiency of a DC/DC converter is about the same as that of the voltage dropout of the diode. Its for this reason that MPPT is often used in systems with 12V lead-acid batteries and very large solar panels requiring multiple chargers. If the panel voltage can be maintained at approximately 1 volt above the battery voltage and the current draw can be kept steady under 1 ampere, near-MPPT performance can be obtained with the right charge controller.

Unlike DC and USB power inputs, voltages and currents are constantly varying in solar panels. The instability of solar panels can cause issues with battery chargers as they constantly turn on and off while trying to draw excessive current from the solar panel causing the voltage to drop. A single solar cell has an open circuit voltage 0.5V when it is not drawing any current. As current begins to increase the voltage begins to collapse and reach 0V at the short circuit current for the solar cell. As light changes the battery charger begins to demand more current from the panel exceeding its short circuit current causing the voltage to collapse and the charger to turn off. Therefore, a charger capable of monitoring the voltage of the solar panel so that it does not demand current past the solar panels short circuit current is needed. With the right battery charger and the capacitor in place to further stabilize the solar panel solar optimization can be achieved. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:Solar-panel-connection}, the connection for the solar panel can be seen. A Schottky diode charges a 4700uF capacitor for the solar panel, the diode prevents any charge in the capacitor to drain back to the panel.
