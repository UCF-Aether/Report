\section{Design Research}
The goal of this section was to explore the various potential components used in
each area of the design including the main compute module, networking IC, gas
sensors, and power components. Research was conducted to evaluate current work 
in air quality sensors, as well as major hardware components require for the 
system. Even almost two years after the start of COVID-19, the electronics supply
chain is showing signs of struggle
as some parts are hard to come by. In our research, we looked at what worked and
didn't for existing low-cost air quality sensors. We also consider various
trade-offs in our sensing design to keep costs low and measurements as accurate
as possible with what is available on the market.
