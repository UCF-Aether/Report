\section{Testing}
With so many moving parts in this project, it will be imperative that a proper
testing protocol and plan is created. The hardware and firmware are arguably the
most important parts of the parts of the project since the remainder of the
project is setup around the sensors and the services they're able to provide.
Without proper testing, then changes later on in the project may introduce
unforeseen problems that will be hard to track down. The hardware needs to work
correctly for the firmware to operate effectively and accurately. Without
accurate sensing, the utility of the project vanishes. The server and web
application will need to tested to ensure a seamless experience for the user.
The firmware will need to have some amount of unit testing for key, critical
systems and functions. Major services will need to have some form of unit and
integration testing. Our test plans will detail the tools and methodologies used
in testing major parts of the project.
