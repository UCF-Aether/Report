\subsection{Development Board}
In order to prototype our sensor node software, LoRaWAN gateway, and server, we are using a development board that uses the same microcontroller and LoRa module that we are going to use for our final design. That development board is the Seeed LoRa-E5 mini. The development board itself is fairly barebones, containing only the LoRa module itself (the STM32WLE5JC), some I/O pins, a USB Type-C input for power, and some antenna connectors. The board does not contain a USB-based programmer, only SWD pins. Instead we had to purchase an external STLink programmer to be able to connect the development board to our computer for programming.
