\subsection{PCB Fabrication Services}
Once the PCB design has been finalized a service will be used to manufacture the PCB according to our digital model. Given the state of global shipping at the moment our group sought out the best solution we could think of and looked for reputable PCB manufacturing within our own country. This brought us into contact with MacroFab. MacroFab is an American company based out of Texas that is globally competitive in quality and price. Typically for a project as such, international corporations are used to meet our electronic needs, but given that this typically comes with months of waiting for manufacturing, shipping, and not always the best quality an American based company can suit our needs in a more immediate fashion. With the cooperation of MacroFab our group can rest easy knowing that if a mistake is made a new PCB could arrive within business days instead of months.
