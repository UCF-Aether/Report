\subsection{Facilities Used for Prototyping and Development}
For our project, we plan on using a variety of tools and lab spaces provided to us through the university. This will be the case primairly for developing and prototyping our hardware. We will have access to the UCF ECE Senior Design Lab. This lab will provide us access to a variety of critical tools for building and testing electronic circuits and hardware. This lab equipment such as oscilloscopes, function generators, and power supplies. In addition, there are important tools related to PCB assembly, such as SMD rework stations, solder and desoldering stations, and a digital microscope inspection station.
