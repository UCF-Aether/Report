\section{Executive Summary}
For this project, we plan to create a sensor network used for measuring
quantities of certain pollutants over a certain area in an urban environment.
The sensor network will consist of multiple identical nodes. These nodes will be
physically mounted in various locations and evenly spread throughout the area to
be monitored. Each node will contain various sensors that will be used to
measure certain pollutants. Each node will also contain a LoRa transceiver that
will be used to send the sensor data to a gateway. This gateway will process
then send this data to an external server over the internet, where it can be
further processed and analyzed. This network should help determine areas of
concern with regards to pollution and, hopefully, allow for measures to be taken
to reduce it. Through the LoRaWAN network server protocol, the nodes will be
able to operate on public networks, such as The Things Network and the Helium
Network, as well as private networks with minimal configuration.
