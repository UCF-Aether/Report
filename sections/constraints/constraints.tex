\section{Related Standards and Design Constraints}
In the following section we will discuss both standards that our design will utilize and constraints that our design must adhere to. Standards are important to make the design process and parts acquisition easier. Understanding and following the constraints when creating the design will ensure that it will function as expected when actually building the design.
